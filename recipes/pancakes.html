        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tbsp Sugar</li>
                <li>1 pinch Salt</li>
                <li>200ml milk</li>
                <li>200g Flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>oil for baking</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat the eggs with the sugar until creamy, then add the milk and stir.</li>
                <li>Now stir in the salt, flour and baking powder until you get a smooth batter.</li>
                <li>If you want particularly fluffy pancakes, separate the eggs and fold the stiffly beaten egg whites into the batter at the very end.</li>
                <li>Now let the finished dough rise a little.</li>
                <li>Using a ladle, place a dollop of batter into the heated, greased pan and fry over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>As soon as small bubbles form, turn the pancake. When the second side is also golden brown, the pancake is done.</li>
                
            </ol>
