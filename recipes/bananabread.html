        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Banana bread - super tasty, wholesome, healthy and wonderfully uncomplicated, also very suitable for small children or as a snack
        
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>3	Banana(s), very ripe (the darker the better), about 300 g</li>
                <li>200 g	Wholemeal wheat flour, alternatively rye flour, white flour, spelled flour</li>
                <li>e.g.	Cinnamon powder (about 1/2 - 1 tsp)</li>
                <li>100 g	Apple, grated, or applesauce without sugar</li>
                <li>½ pack	baking powder</li>
                <li>2	egg(s)</li>
                <li>50g	Walnuts, chopped, alternatively almonds, hazelnuts</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the apple, core it and grate it finely (alternatively, you can use apple sauce that hasn't had any added sugar).</li>
                <li>Peel the bananas, add to the apple and mash well.</li>
                <li>Now beat with the two eggs until fluffy.</li>
                <li>Mix the flour, baking powder and cinnamon, add to the banana-apple-egg mash and mix briefly but well. Finally, fold in the chopped walnuts and pour everything into a greased loaf pan. The larger the pan, the flatter the bread.</li>
                <li>Now bake in a hot oven at 180 °C top/bottom heat for about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Do a chopstick test.</li>
                <li>Bread rises well in the oven, but collapses a little when it cools (like cheesecake, for example). The dough remains more "sloppy", i.e. more compact than e.g. B. Cake batter. Be sure to let cool completely before slicing!</li>
            </ol>
